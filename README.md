# Aroma Programming

### Program the smell/aroma
This is the first repository in history to create program realted to generate armona on different code configuration

Humans have 5 sensory organs - eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin.

Humans have brains and we are creating and using AI to replicate the same task.
Eyes - Related programming already exist, like Image Processing or any Image Kind of Coding and Graphics.
Ears - We have successfully processed audio.
Skin - We have so many ML softwares which can detect skin cancer.

But we don't have anything related to **smell(nose) or taste(tongue)** programming.
So I'm urging every researcher and world's famous person to take a look on this repository or create that programming.

Special Thank's in Advanced
