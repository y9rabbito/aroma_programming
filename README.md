# Aroma Programming 

### Program the smell/aroma 
üò∂‚Äçüå´ This is the first repository in history to create program related to generate armona on different code configuration

Humans have 5 sensory organs - *eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin.*

Humans have **brains** and we are creating and using AI to replicate the same task.
**Eyes** - Related programming already exist, like Image Processing or any Image Kind of Coding and Graphics.
**Ears** - We have successfully processed audio.
**Skin** - We have so many ML softwares which can detect skin cancer.

But we don't have anything related to **smell(nose) or taste(tongue)** programming.
So I'm urging every researcher and world's famous person to take a look on this repository or create that programming.

Special Thank's in Advanced

**So, why not to give a try.**
